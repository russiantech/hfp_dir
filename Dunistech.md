Report on Training:

Online  session for coding fundamentals completed for `Hamidah`, pending presentations

Physical  saturdays only:
    We've concluded CSS, as a rule their projects must be done b/4 progressing to next step(JS).
    `Darlington & Vivian` have not been coming maybe due to the fact that they still have pending projects they're working on.

Physical Daily (JAVASCRIPT):
    Number of students 9:
    Gaius n Yusuf
    Shalom, Sharon, Bayo, Ayo, Mike, Daniel, Daniel Junior.
    We've completed JS as well, after presentation for this, they'll migrate to others.

    challenges here: mike is not consistent, Daniel Senior is complaining of his laptp keyboards malfunctioning.
    Gaius &  Yusuf are unserious.
